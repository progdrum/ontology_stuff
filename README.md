# Programmatic Ontologies

A collection of ontologies in development, defined programmatically. The ontologies in this repository have been developed using the [Hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy) programming language the the [Owlready2 library](https://github.com/pwin/owlready2) developed for use with Python.

## Drum heads and Cymbals

This is a simple ontology outlining relationships between drums and cymbals, manufacturers of such, and other properties of these objects. Some test instances have been included to demonstrate the proper functioning of the ontology.
