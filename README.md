# Ontology_Stuff

A collection of ontologies that I have/am developing, mostly using the Hy
programming language.

## Beer Ontology

This code produces an ontology based on the 2015 guidelines of the Beer
Judge Certification Program (BJCP) found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronsantos/bjcp-beer-styles).

## Drum heads/Cymbals

Produces an ontology of drum head and cymbal types. Further details are
available on my [blog](https://progdrum.github.io/hy_owl/).
